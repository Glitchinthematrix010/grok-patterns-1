# grok-patterns
A collection of GROK patterns for Logstash.

These were created as I was learning how to use GROK and Logstash, so please do not take them as gospel. Hopefully they can be useful to someone learning to create their own rules.

I will be updating these in the near future. Please contact me with any questions you may have.
